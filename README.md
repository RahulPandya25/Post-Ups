# Post-Ups
A Social Website Application built completely around NoSQL Database. Anyone can submit their post here on the application, and this Post is not only subjected to Text, but it can be an Image, Video or any other document or perhaps a combination of these. A post can have tags through which one can query and filter according to their needs, an upvote/downvote feature  and comments that can be text or images(Gifs included).
One can even search for their desired post using the categories in which the post falls in, like plain text, images, videos or their combinations on top of the existing search using tags features. Sorting them on the bases of the number of comments they received or perhaps the likes or dislikes will also be available. 
With this varying and uncertain structure of a single post, we considered NoSQL will be the best fit for this application instead of a regular Relational Database.
